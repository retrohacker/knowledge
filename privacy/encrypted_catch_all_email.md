# Encrypted Catch All Email

I've been using Protonmail for going on a year now, and I recently upgraded to a pro account to support the project.

ProtonMail is an end-to-end encrypted email service created at the CERN research facility. ProtonMail uses client-side encryption to protect email contents and user data before they are sent to ProtonMail servers. Their email clients also refuse to load remote content by default, which prevents invisible "read receipts" that advertisers use to track how you are consuming your emails.

By upgrading, you get what is known as a "catch all" email address. This allows you to create a new email address for every person you talk to. For example I can now provide:
* crowneplaza@blankenship.io
* target@blankenship.io
* bestbuy@blankenship.io

While all of these emails are distinct, they will all go into the same inbox.

By giving a unique email address to everyone you interact with, you can track how folks are using (and sharing!) you're email address. On top of that, you can use these for filters, so if someone shares your email address with a bunch of advertisers you can condemn that address to go straight to the trash for the rest of forever!

This returns control of your email back to you, no longer do you have to "unsubscribe" or work with complicated filters when your email address gets shared with advertisers, you can just send your spam straight to the trash! It also let's you know who shared your personal information, since their name is now on the 3rd party spam!

At this point, other folks are able to send emails using your email address, and nobody will be able to verify if it came from you or not! This is not good! You _absolutely_ should follow this next guide.
