# Encrypted Catch All Email

I've been using Protonmail for going on a year now, and I've finally decided to step up and start funding the project. It's a bit pricy ($75 per year) but it seems to support a great cause. These folks appear to give the right fucks about the right things, and I like that.

Protonmail provides what is known as at rest encryption for email. When they receive an email they will encrypt it to your private key. From that point forward, only the person holding your private key will be able to decrypt that email. While their system isn't perfect, it should be Good Enough(tm) for most people, as long as you aren't the next Edward Snowden. If your goal is to prevent everyone but super interested well funded advanced actors from accessing your emails, this system is pretty great. Not only do they not mine your email for targeted advertising, they would have to steal your password in order to even look at your email. Your email is decrypted locally on your device! Their email clients also refuse to load remote content by default, which prevents invisible "read receipts" that advertisers use to track how you are consuming your emails.

By upgrading, I get what is known as a "catch all" email address. This allows me to create a new email address for every person I talk to, for example:
* crowneplaza@blankenship.io
* target@blankenship.io
* bestbuy@blankenship.io

While all of these emails are distinct, they will all go into the same inbox. This allows me to track how folks are using (and sharing!) my email address. On top of that, I can use these for filters, so if someone shares my email address with a bunch of advertisers I can condemn that address to go straight to the trash for the rest of forever! This returns control of my email back to me, no longer do I have to "unsubscribe" or work with complicated filters, I can just send your spam straight to the trash!
